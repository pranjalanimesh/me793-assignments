# ME 793 Assignments

These assignments are part of the course ME 793: Multiscale Materials Informatics, Discovery and Design at IIT Bombay. The course is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of the Data Science and Statistics in perspective of materials and its implementation and application to solve real-world problems. The assignments are designed to provide hands-on experience with the concepts taught in the course.

I'll be updating my code files and the assignments as I progress through the course.

### Assignment 1 : LU Decomposition and Matrix Inversion
The first assignment is to implement the LU Decomposition and Matrix Inversion from scratch. The LU Decomposition is a method to decompose a matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix. The matrix inversion is a method to find the inverse of a matrix using the LU Decomposition.

### Assignment 2 : Singular Value Decomposition
The second assignment is to implement the Singular Value Decomposition. The Singular Value Decomposition is a method to decompose a matrix into the product of three matrices. The SVD is used in various applications such as Principal Component Analysis, Image Compression, and many more.
